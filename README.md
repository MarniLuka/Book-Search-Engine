# Book Search Engine

## Description
Refactored a functioning Google Books API search engine from RESTful API to a GraphQl API built with Apollo Server.

## Usage
On the [deployed website](https://book-search-engine-0611.herokuapp.com/), one can sign up or login if an account has already been made. Then, simply search for a book in the search engine and click 'Save This Book!', allowing one to keep track of books they have read, or books they would like to read. 

## Credits
Starter code was provided by the [GATech Coding Bootcamp](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli).
